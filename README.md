## Builds

### [PWA (Progressive Web App - Web app that anyone can optionally install through the browser)](https://quasar.dev/quasar-cli/developing-pwa/introduction)

This is the default web app. You can "install" the PWA through the options on the right drawer.

### [Capacitor (Mobile - Android, iOS)](https://quasar.dev/quasar-cli/developing-capacitor-apps/introduction)

I can't build iOS apps because I don't have a Mac currently. If you have one, simply follow the steps if you wish to build the app.

### [Electron (Desktop - Windows, Linux, MacOS)](https://quasar.dev/quasar-cli/developing-electron-apps/introduction)

I will only build for Windows because that's the platform I'm using at the moment. Feel free to build for other platforms.
